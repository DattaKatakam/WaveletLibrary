# WaveletLibrary
This library generates the waves of different types like sine, cosine, square, fourier, toothsaw, random noise signal, cwt (continous wavelet transform), also performs DFT ( direct fourier tranform) on waves.
Mainly Vectors are used in this whole concept since interface is QT, so i used Qvectors.
